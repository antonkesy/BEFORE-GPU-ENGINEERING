> **<span style="color: #ff0000;">New to GPU Engineering? Start Here.</span>**
> If you are diving into CUDA, kernel programming, or LLM inference, consider this your ultimate prerequisite. Before battling complex textbooks or dense research papers, read this series. You will build a rock-solid, first-principles foundation to actually understand advanced literature and write aggressively fast code.

### 📖 The Philosophy
This repository documents my journey learning GPU engineering, built in public, note by note, from the ground up. **No hand-waving or abstract jargon.** Just logic gates, memory buses, and first principles.

### 🎯 Who Is This For?
**Developers, students, and self-learners** who want to understand *how* and *why* GPUs are so fast for AI and heavy compute, without getting immediately bogged down in complex CUDA syntax or graphics APIs. If you understand basic programming but GPUs feel like black magic, this is for you.

### 🚀 What Will You Learn?
<span style="color: #eab308; font-weight: bold;">By the end of this series, you will no longer see the GPU as a black box. You will be able to:</span>
- **Reason from first principles** about architecture (warps, SMs, memory hierarchy, tensor cores).
- **Diagnose bottlenecks** intuitively (compute-bound vs. memory-bound, latency hiding).
- **Learn CUDA/Triton faster**, by understanding the *why* behind thread blocks and memory coalescing.
- **Optimize AI workloads** with a deep mechanical sympathy for hardware.

### 💡 How to Use This Resource
Treat this as a structured book. **<span style="color: #ff0000; font-weight: bold;">Start from Chapter 1 and read sequentially.</span>** The concepts build heavily on each other. You cannot understand matrix tiling without understanding shared memory, and you cannot understand shared memory without understanding the memory wall.
